<div id="sidebar" class="rounded-corners"><span class="badge">1</span> This is my sidebar. <br> There are many like it, but this one is mine. <br> 
My sidebar is my best friend. <br> It is my life. <br> I must master it as I must master my life. <br> My sidebar, without me, is useless. <br> Without my sidebar, I am useless. <br> I must position my sidebar true. <br> I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. <br> I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will... <br> <span class="badge badge-important">2</span>
My sidebar and myself know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, or the smoke we make. <br> We know that it is the hits that count.  <br> We will hit...
My sidebar is human, even as I, because it is my life. <br>  Thus, I will learn it as a brother. <br>  I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. <br>  I will keep my sidebar clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. <br>  We will become part of each other. We will... <br> 
Before God, I swear this creed. <br>  My sidebar and myself are the defenders of my country. <br>  We are the masters of our enemy. <br>  We are the saviors of my life.
So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace! <br><span class="badge">1</span> Parody of "This is my Rifle" <br>
 <span class="badge badge-important">2</span> I do not condone war.
